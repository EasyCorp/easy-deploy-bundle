Hi @Lustmored , thanks for the PR.
The travis build fails:

Problem 1

    - symfony/console v5.0.0 requires php ^7.2.5 -> your PHP version (7.1.27) does not satisfy that requirement.

As 7.1 is EOL, I think we should change the version to 7.2.  Can you make a try please?

Can I please accept this pull request?

The PR can't be accepted as checks are failing. The PHP version requirements must be changed to ^7.2.5

Sorry guys for taking long to answer, didn't receive notifications somehow. I am experimenting with PHP version constraints, not a Travis master but will do my best.

I've allowed myself to bump PHP dependency in composer.json and extended test config with 3 major Symfony versions (3.4, 4.4 and 5.0). I am not sure it actually tests against components from specified version. but couldn't find better solution.

Anyways all tests are passing right now. Once again sorry for the delay.
